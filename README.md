Theoretical Machine Learning (APPM 4490/5490) class, Spring 2022, at CU Boulder

This github repo currently has a mix of new (Spring 2022) and old material (from when I previously taught it Spring 2020 under the special topics number APPM 7400).

[Syllabus](syllabus.md)

The **old** syllabus for Spring 2020 is [APPM7400_Spr20_TheoreticalML_syllabus.pdf](APPM7400_Spr20_TheoreticalML_syllabus.pdf).  This is *not* for Spring 2022.
