[Catalog description](https://catalog.colorado.edu/search/?search=APPM+4490): Presents the underlying theory behind machine learning in proofs-based format. Answers fundamental questions about what learning means and what can be learned via formal models of statistical learning theory. Analyzes some important classes of machine learning methods. Specific topics may include the PAC framework, VC-dimension and Rademacher complexity.

Requires **prerequisite** course of APPM 4440 "Real Analysis" (minimum grade C-).  

For graduate students, there is no enforced prereq, but we suggest mathematical maturity and hopefully an undergraduate or graduate class in analysis, as this is a proofs-based math class.  Familiarity with linear algebra and probability is assumed, and some familiarity with machine learning (like CSCI 5622) is nice but not essential.

## Instructor and contact Information

- The instructor is [Stephen Becker](http://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/becker/), Associate Professor of Applied Mathematics
- Contact him at <stephen.becker@colorado.edu>
- Office: 338 ECOT (engineering center, office tower)
- There is no teaching assistant

### Meeting times and location
Meeting time: MWF 11:15 AM - 12:05 AM

Location: ECCR 151 (Engineering Center)

### Office Hours
3 hours per week, held in a hybrid fashion: attend the physical office (338 ECOT) or via zoom (link is posted in Canvas)

Times:

TBD

There is no TA

### Estimated Workload
This is intended to have less of a workload than a core class, though it will depend a lot on the student's background. This is a three credit course (the standard kind of course).

### Course Format
This is a lecture-based course, and the instructor will present proofs. The textbooks provide supplementary material and homework problems. Students are expected to read the book as necessary to fill in gaps not covered in lecture. Reading the book before lecture is useful but not required. Homeworks will require students to write proofs, synthesizing concepts learned from lecture and the book.

### Homeworks

There will be homeworks, due either weekly or bi-weekly. You are allowed to drop one homework (this will be done automatically).  

### Grading
- 80% homeworks.
  - Late homework is not accepted, but you are allowed one free "dropped" homework. Your lowest-scoring homework will be automatically dropped. See below for caveat
- 10% Midterm (in class)
- 10% Final Project (open-ended)

**There is no in-class final exam.**  However, we will do student project presentations during our final exam time.
- Our final exam slot is 1:30 PM to 4 PM on Tuesday, April 28 2026

The overall grade may be **curved** as appropriate (not guaranteed), but note that there is no set "quota" of A's, B's, etc., so you are not directly competing with your classmates.

**Graduate students** or anyone enrolled in 5490 (instead of 4490) will be given extra homework and/or exam problems, and must do the final project on their own.  Students enrolled in 4490 may form groups of two for the final project.

### Late assignment and cheating policy

In general, **late homework** assignments are not accepted; instead, you can use your one dropped homework.  Under exceptional circumstances (such as serious illness, including COVID-19, or serious family issues), homework can be turned in late.  If the reason is foreseeable (e.g., planned travel), you must contact the instructor in advance.

Examples:

- Your sister is getting married and you have to travel out-of-state.  That's great, but this is when you use the one dropped homework, or turn the homework in early. This is foreseeable, and not an "emergency", so it does not count as an exceptional circumstance.
- A close family member becomes infected with COVID-19 and you have to return to your home country to take care of family.  This *does* count as an exceptional circumstance. Please email the instructor to discuss arrangements.

**Cheating** is not acceptable.  Take-home exams and homeworks are easy to cheat on if you really want to, but as this is an upper-division course, I am relying on the fact that students are here to learn (and paying the university to do so), and thus cheating does not make sense.  Cheating does not hurt the instructor, it hurts the student (and hurts the grades of honest classmates).

If a student is caught cheating, on the first occurrence, the penalty ranges from losing points on the item in question (like one test problem; this is for very minor infractions) to losing all points for the assignment (i.e., the entire homework or entire exam). Students may be referred to the honor council. On the second occurrence of cheating, similar penalties may apply, and additionally the student may fail the class, at the instructor's discretion.

"Minor infractions" include not following the instructions during an exam (in person or remote). For example, if the instructions on a remote test are to keep your microphone on and your hands in sight of your webcam, then failing to follow these instructions construes a minor infraction, and (even though cheating may not be proven) you are subject to losing points.

On homeworks, you are free to **collaborate** with other students, and to use resources like the internet appropriately. However, you must do your own work. There is a gray area between collaboration and cheating, and we rely on the students' and instructors discretion.  Copying code verbatim is never permissible.  You should be writing up your own work, and explaining answers in your own words.  Snippets of code are allowed to be similar (sometimes there is only one good way to do it), but longer chunks of code should never be identical.  If not expressly forbidden by the assignment, you may use the internet, but you may never post for help on online forums.  (Regarding forums, please use our Piazza website if you want a Q&A forum).

Cheating is not usually an issue in this class, and I have faith that students will continue to act appropriately.

### Course website

We will use [github](https://github.com/stephenbeckr/ML-theory-class) for public content (notes, demos, syllabus), and use CU's default LMT **Canvas** for private content like grades and homework solutions.  Canvas will also be used to organize things, like any recorded lectures, comments made via **Gradescope**, and Q&A forums via **piazza**.

### Acceptable use of AI in this class

Students are allowed to:

- use "autocomplete" style coding assistance, like Copilot.  (*Why? because this is now as ubiquitious as spell-check, and it has become part of how people program.*) However, we strongly suggest you to use it sparingly, and to double-check!

- use LLMs to ask for documentation, but not with an AI that has access to your code. For example, you can google documentation and use the "AI generated summaries" provided by Google, but you cannot use Github copilot integrated with VS Code, or gemini integraded with colab (nor any context-aware chatbot).

- we **discourage** AI use whenever possible -- you don't need practice with it (it's easy!), and college is the time to practice your non-AI skills

- Tools like wolfram Alpha, Desmos, etc., are allowed unless explicitly disallowed for a particular problem, but we discourage their use. They will **not** be allowed on the midterms, so please do not get reliant on them.

Students are **not allowed** to:

- explicitly asking a LLM, like ChatGPT/Claude..., to **solve** anything for you. This covers both code and math.
  - For example, putting in the text of a homework problem and asking a LLM to generate the solution (or code) is not allowed.

#### Enforcement
For any major assignment (homework, or take-home exam if relevant), the instructor reserves the right to randomly check students, and/or check students with suspicious work.  If a student is checked, they will need to do a live session with the instructor (either live-coding if it is coding related, or a whiteboard session if it is math related) so that the instructor can ask the student questions or give them tasks.

#### Consequences of violating policy

- First-time minor violations of the AI policy will result in losing points on the specific problem; the amount of points lost is up to instructor discretion, depending on the severity of the infraction

- Major violations, or repeat violations, will result in a 0 on the entire relevant assignment

- Egregious and/or repeated major violations will result in failing the class


### Dropping the Course
Advice from your department advisor is recommended before dropping any course. After 11:59 PM Jan. 23 2026, dropping a course results in a "W" on your transcript and you’ll be billed for tuition. After 11:59 PM March 24 2026, dropping the course is possible only with a petition approved by the Dean’s office.

(The last day to *add* a class is Wed Jan. 16 2026)

# Syllabus

A proofs based course on the underlying theory behind machine learning. Instead of chasing the latest-greatest algorithm, the course asks fundamental questions about what learning means and what can be learned (by anyone or anything). To answer these questions, formal models of statistical learning theory are used, requiring math, probability, statistics and optimization

### Official course description
Presents the underlying theory behind machine learning in proofs-based format. Answers fundamental questions about what learning means and what can be learned via formal models of statistical learning theory. Analyzes some important classes of machine learning methods. Specific topics may include the PAC framework, VC-dimension and Rademacher complexity.

(Mostly focuses on binary classification, and
almost exclusively focuses on supervised learning and the PAC model.)

### Principal Topics
PAC framework, VC-dimension, Rademacher complexity, bias-variance tradeoffs, no-free lunch theorems, model selection, boosting, expressive power

### Learning Goals/Outcomes
[//]: # ( Not testable; high-level )
[//]: # ( Learning Objectives, i.e., quantifiable outcomes )
[//]: # ( Something measurable )
The aim of the course is to show students a few possible frameworks in which they can formally analyze machine learning algorithms. Since machine learning is hyped by the media, it is important for students to understand fundamental limits as to what is possible. Furthermore, students will gain an understanding of the assumptions and limitations of the models, and when the theoretical bounds
are not useful.

### Learning Objectives
After taking the course, students will be able to understand the standard frameworks, and analyze standard algorithms within this framework. Students will understand key terms as used in the field, like bias, variance, expressiveness, learnability, training, and generalization. Students will be be able to identify when analysis is possible or impossible. Students will understand that alternative learning models and tasks exist, and know when each model is most appropriate, and in particular be able to evaluate the assumptions and shortcomings of a given model.


### Programming
There may be a bit of programming involved in some homeworks. Any reasonable language (e.g., Python, R, Matlab, Julia) is acceptable.
