# APPM 4490/5490 Theoretical Machine Learning Final Project

- The project is due at the beginning of class on Monday April 25, 2022.  The last two days of class (Mon April 25 and Wed April 27) will be used for presentations.
  - There is no final exam
- The project consists of a 10 minute presentation and a short paper. There is no strict length requirement for the paper, but aim for 4 to 6 pages (including figures). Paper lengths are a guideline, as I’m aware you can add figures, code, adjust white space and font to make it longer/shorter.
- If you really wanted to, you could write a longer, much more detailed paper and skip the presentation
- On Monday April 25, we will determine the presentation order. You must be ready to present that day in case you are chosen.
- Group sizes
  - Graduate students must do the project on their own
  - Undergraduate students (i.e., anyone enrolled in 4490 not 5490) may form groups of up to 2 (and in fact groups are encouraged)
- By Friday April 22, email me to let me know your group, so I know how many groups there are; this will help me schedule the presentations.
- The project is 10% of your overall class grade. It cannot be dropped.
- Deliverables:
  - Written paper (typeset; Latex is suggested but not required), turned in via Canvas
  - 10 minute talk
  - Slides for the talk (turned in via Canvas)
- More details:
  - Class participation is extra important these days, as a sign of respect to your fellow students.  You lose 10% of your project grade if you do not attend any of these last 2 days (unless you have a valid reason, like international travel, and contacted me about it beforehand).
  - You also lose 10% of your project grade if you are not ready to present on the day when you're scheduled to speak.
## What is a valid project?
- The project can be theoretical or computational (or both)
- One option is a "traditional" class-project, where you investigate an idea, and/or run simulations or do derivations or proofs, and/or connect several different ideas (e.g., create new ideas, though the originality/impact obviously does not have to rise to the level of a journal publication);
- You're encouraged to pursue an area related to your research interests
- Specific journal articles are a good starting point
  - You can reproduce their results
  - You can compare several methods
  - You can apply a method to a new problem or area
  - You can tweak a method
  - You can redo theoretical derivations more clearly (or with more details)
  - You can do a "book-report style" analysis of a paper, critical evaluating it (think of it as a peer-review for an article)
- Your results do not have to be novel; you do not need to write a journal quality paper!
- You'll want to related your project to something you learned in the class (see Rubric item #2)
- When in doubt about whether a project idea is valid, you can always email the instructor and ask!
- You can see the project titles from previous years at the [Student projects](https://github.com/stephenbeckr/ML-theory-class#student-projects) part of the main README file in the parent github directory.
## Rubric
Because the type of report is a bit open-ended, the rubric below is necessarily a bit vague:
1. Valid/interesting project (25%), and point of project is clear. For example, for an independent investigation, the problem you are trying to solve is explained and motivated and non-trivial. For a book-report style project, presenting on a paper, you need some kind of thesis (e.g., “This paper shows the power of this approach...”) and not just a summary, and explain why you chose that paper. For reproducing the results of a paper (computationally or analytically by going through a proof in extra detail), explain why you chose the paper, and why you are interested in their results (are they amazing results? do you distrust them? do they nicely illustrate concepts from class)?

2. Relate the project to a concept from class (25%). **Your project must include a paragraph describing how it involves concepts learned in class.**

3. Insightful discussion (25%). You should discuss/analyze your results, and/or validate a conclusion. For a paper review, you should discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the paper. For a project that involves generating your own results, the quality of the actual work is included in this category.

4. Professional communication (25%) of the written document and the oral presentation (and the slides). Well-organized and precise communication, grammatically correct writing, nicely format- ted documents and figures. Figures should be labeled appropriately.

Here is a [more detailed rubric](ProjectRubric.pdf) that I will actually use for grading the projects.
