# APPM 4490/5490 Theory of ML: Homeworks

- Homeworks are listed here
- Students should follow instructions on Canvas for turning in homeworks
  -  We'll either use Canvas directly, or do a Gradescope+Canvas system
  - You do *not* have to use latex! Only if you really want to.
- Homework solutions are on Canvas
- Old homeworks from Spring 2020 are in the [OldHW_spring2020](OldHW_spring2020) folder
